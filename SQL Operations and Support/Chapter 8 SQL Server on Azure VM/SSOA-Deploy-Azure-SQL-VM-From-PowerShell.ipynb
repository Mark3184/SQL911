                "Why is this covered?  Most people when the deploy Azure Services for the first time, use the Azure Portal just like we did in the previous notebook.  The Portal is great for learning how SQL Server is installed to an Azure VM with the many menu-driven options and drop-down selections.  Using the Portal is likely the best option if you just need to get something deployed and won't have to do it more than once or twice.  However, when using the Portal, it is very easy to deploy your SQL Servers 'differently'.  For example, maybe the first time you deployed SQL, you chose a SQL Server 2016 Enterprise Edition with HDD disks on Windows Server 2016.  Then, you deploy a 2nd SQL Server, but you didn't realize that you chose a different version of SQL and you used Premium SSD disks.  Generally in an enterprise, you want all things to be consistent so that you can have good control of performance charasteristics.\n",
