                "<span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Modern processors have multiple cores per socket. Each socket is represented, usually, as a single NUMA node. The SQL Server database engine partitions various internal structures and partitions service threads per NUMA node. With processors containing 10 or more cores per socket, using software NUMA to split hardware NUMA nodes generally increases scalability and performance. Prior to SQL Server 2014 (12.x) SP2, software-based NUMA (soft-NUMA) required you to edit the registry to add a node configuration affinity mask, and was configured at the host level, rather than per instance. Starting with SQL Server 2014 (12.x) SP2 and SQL Server 2016 (13.x), soft-NUMA is configured automatically at the database-instance level when the SQL Server Database Engine service starts.</span>\n",

                "With SQL Server 2016 (13.x), whenever the SQL Server Database Engine detects more than eight physical cores per NUMA node or socket at startup, soft-NUMA nodes are created automatically by default. Hyper-threaded processor cores are not differentiated when counting physical cores in a node. When the detected number of physical cores is more than eight per socket, the SQL Server Database Engine creates soft-NUMA nodes that ideally contain eight cores, but can go down to five or up to nine logical cores per node. The size of the hardware node can be limited by a CPU affinity mask. The number of NUMA nodes never exceeds the maximum number of supported NUMA nodes. \n",
