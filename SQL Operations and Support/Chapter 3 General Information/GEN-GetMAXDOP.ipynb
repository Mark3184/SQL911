                "When an instance of SQL Server runs on a computer that has more than one microprocessor or CPU, the Database Engine detects whether parallelism can be used. The degree of parallelism sets the number of processors employed to run a single statement, for each parallel plan execution. You can use the max degree of parallelism option to limit the number of processors to use in parallel plan execution. SQL Server considers parallel execution plans for queries, index data definition language (DDL) operations, parallel inserts, online alter column, parallel stats collection, and static and keyset-driven cursor population.\n",

                "- Setting max degree of parallelism (MAXDOP) to 0 allows SQL Server to use all the available processors up to 64 processors. However, this is not the recommended value for most cases.\n",
                "- To suppress parallel plan generation, set max degree of parallelism to 1.  Set the value to a number from 1 to 32,767 to specify the maximum number of processor cores that can be used during a single query execution. If a value greater than the number of available processors is specified, the actual number of available processors is used. If the computer has only one processor, the max degree of parallelism value is ignored.\n",
                "- The max degree of parallelism limit is set per task. It is not a per request or per query limit. This means that during a parallel query execution, a single request can spawn multiple tasks up to the MAXDOP limit, and each task will use one worker and one scheduler. For more information, see the Scheduling parallel tasks section in the Thread and Task Architecture Guide.\n",

You can override the max degree of parallelism value for index operations by specifying the MAXDOP index option in the index statement.
