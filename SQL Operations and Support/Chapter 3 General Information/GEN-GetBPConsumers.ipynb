The output of this view can be used to determine the distribution of database pages in the buffer pool according to database, object, or type. In SQL Server, this dynamic management view also returns information about the data pages in the buffer pool extension file. For more information, see Buffer Pool Extension, read this excellent doc on the [Buffer pool extension - SQL Server | Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/database-engine/configure-windows/buffer-pool-extension?view=sql-server-ver15)\n",
