                "\n",
                "There is a difference between truncating a transaction log and shrinking a transaction log. [Log Truncation](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/relational-databases/logs/the-transaction-log-sql-server#Truncation) occurs normally during a transaction log backup, and is a logical operation which removes committed records inside the log, whereas [log shrinking](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/t-sql/database-console-commands/dbcc-shrinkfile-transact-sql#shrinking-a-log-file) reclaims physical space on the file system by reducing the file size. Log truncation occurs on a [virtual-log-file (VLF)](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/relational-databases/sql-server-transaction-log-architecture-and-management-guide#physical_arch) boundary, and a log file may contain many VLFs. A log file can be shrunk only if there is empty space inside the log file to reclaim. Shrinking a log file alone cannot solve the problem of a full log file, instead, you must discover why the log file is full and cannot be truncated.\n",
                "\n",
                "> <mark>Warning</mark> Data that is moved to shrink a file can be scattered to any available location in the file. This causes index fragmentation and might slow the performance of queries that search a range of the index. To eliminate the fragmentation, consider rebuilding the indexes on the file after shrinking. For more information, see [Shrink a database](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/relational-databases/databases/shrink-a-database).\n",
