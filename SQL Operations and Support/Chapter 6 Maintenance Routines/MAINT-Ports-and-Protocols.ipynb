                "    - By default Named instances (including SQL Server Express) use dynamic ports. \n",

                "    - Because the port selected might change every time that the Database Engine is started, it is difficult to configure the firewall to enable access to the correct port number. Therefore, if a firewall is started, we recommend reconfiguring the Database Engine to use the same port number every time. \n",

                "    - One alternative to a port strategy would be configuring a named instance to listen on a fixed port and then to create an exception in the firewall for a SQL Server program name such as sqlservr.exe (for the Database Engine).  This can be convenient, but the port number will not appear in the Local Port column of the Inbound Rules page when you are using the Windows Firewall with Advanced Security MMC snap-in. \n",
