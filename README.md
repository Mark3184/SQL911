# SQL911 Jupyter Notebook for Azure Data Studio
## For the day-to-day care and feeding of your SQL Server enterprise

Did you know that Jupyter Notebooks can help you manage your SQL Server enterprise no matter how large or small?  This Jupyter Notebook in Azure Data Studio was created to be a DBA’s handbook of resources, knowledge, code, trouble-shooting tips, and step-by-step examples on how to Administer, Monitor, Troubleshoot, Fix and Repair issues you may encounter in your day-to-day life as a DBA.  This notebook brings you content developed over a career of consulting at some of the world’s largest SQL customers. 

COVID19 was the Inspiration for this Notebook.  Most Microsoft Consultants were prevented from traveling on site to our customers during the first year of the pandemic.  I needed to create some sort of remote-delivery mechanism that will be as close as possible to actually being on site, to help customers continue to deploy, manage, and provide for the day to day “care and feeding” of their SQL Server and data platforms, even when we could not be on-site and the DBA’s had to work from home or operate with limited staff in the data center. 

Now that you have cloned this notebook locally, you will notice that it is not complete.  There are so many aspects of SQL Server and Data, that if I tried to capture them all on day-1, before making this notebook public, it would never get published.  So, this notebook is a work in progress.  Feel free to check back from time to time for new content as I add sections for Azure SQL DB, Azure SQL Managed Instance, SQL Server on Azure VM's and so much more.

Dedicated to all of the Data Gunslingers who love SQL Server.

All my best in your journey!

Kevin
